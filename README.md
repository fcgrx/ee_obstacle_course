ExpressionEngine Obstacle Course for Syntax Highlighting
========================================================

This file was created to evaluate ExpressionEngine syntax highlighting, initially for my own attempts to create the most complete and thorough EE syntax package for Sublime Text.

It contains:

* every code block and example from the ExpressionEngine User Guide
* an exhaustive (hopefully) list of EE tags including global variables, constants
* tags and variables from built-in add-ons
* code examples that are particularly challenging for a syntax highlighter
* deprecated tags
